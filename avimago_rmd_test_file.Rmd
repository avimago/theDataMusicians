## Introduction

## The Data Set
```{r}
library(dplyr)
IBM <- read.csv("WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv")
colnames(IBM)[1] <- "Age"
IBM <- select(IBM, Age:EducationField, EnvironmentSatisfaction:NumCompaniesWorked, OverTime:RelationshipSatisfaction, StockOptionLevel:YearsWithCurrManager) %>% 
  mutate(TotalSatisfaction=EnvironmentSatisfaction+JobSatisfaction+RelationshipSatisfaction+WorkLifeBalance)

library(ggplot2)
Att_TotalSat <- select(IBM, Attrition, TotalSatisfaction)
ggplot(Att_TotalSat,aes(x=Attrition, y=TotalSatisfaction))+geom_boxplot()
```
We can see from the boxplot that there is a relationship between employees who left the company in the end has a lower average total satisfaction
